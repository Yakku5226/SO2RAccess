## Game Key Bindings (Original)

<!-- CRITICAL: Fill this during Tier 1 analysis! Every key the game uses.
Without this list, mod keys WILL conflict with game controls. -->

- (not yet documented — MUST be done before Phase 2)

## Implemented Features

- **Config menu announcements** (`ConfigMenuHandler.cs`)
  - "Config, N of Total: Category" when the config category menu opens or focus moves
  - "[Setting]: [Value], N of Total" when a submenu opens or focus moves
  - "[Value]" announced alone when left/right adjusts a setting value
  - Unavailable/button-only items announced without value
  - Label source: Strategy 2 — GameText inside each selector's own hierarchy (not sibling walk)

- **Title menu announcements** (`TitleMenuHandler.cs`)
  - "Press any button to start" when the title screen appears
  - "[Item]" when the menu opens or focus moves (no prefix)
  - Adds ", unavailable" for greyed-out items (e.g. Load Game with no save)

  - "[Action]: [Button], N of Total" on navigation up/down
  - "[Action]: unassigned, N of Total" if no button assigned
  - "Press a button to assign." when confirm pressed on an action
  - Re-announces current item after button assignment
  - Button names read from `icon` GameText (sprite tag stripped of controller-type prefix)
  - Handles PS4/PS5/Xbox/Switch/PC controller types automatically

  - Data read from UISaveLoadListItemData fields (pre-formatted strings from the game)

- **NPC/story dialogue** (`DialogueHandler.cs`)
  - "[Name]: [text]" when a dialogue line appears (NPC has a name shown)
  - "[text]" when no speaker name is present (narration, anonymous lines)
  - Fires on each new page as player advances through dialogue
  - Hooks: UIConversationPresenter.SetMessage(message, talkerName, voiceID, isWait, ref Rect)
  - TMP markup tags stripped before announcing

- **Tutorial boxes** (`NotificationHandler.cs`) ✓ TESTED

  - "Camp menu." when the camp opens
  - "[Item], N of total." when navigating the root menu (Status, Item, Equip, BattleSkill, Formation, etc.)
  - Greyed-out items announced with ", unavailable"
  - Re-announces current item when returning from a sub-screen
  - Root menu type: UICampMenuSelector (field menuSelector on UICampWindow)
  - Item data: UICampMenuItemData.menuItem (UIDefine.CampMenuItem enum), canDecisioned (availability)
  - Approach: polling currentIndex from Main.UpdateHandlers() — navigation is native-only, no Harmony hook fires
  - Item names currently use enum.ToString() (e.g. "BattleSkill") — can be refined with Loc entries

- **Camp item sub-screen announcements** (`CampMenuHandler.cs`) ✓ TESTED

- **Post-battle result announcements** (`BattleResultHandler.cs`) — PENDING RETEST
  - Now announces SP and BSP totals after EXP/Fol
  - Level-ups include per-character BSP gained and learned battle skill names
  - Skill names resolved via ParameterManager → TextManager chain (may need fallback if TextManager doesn't resolve)

- **Battle target announcements** (`BattleTargetHandler.cs`) ✓ TESTED
  - Hold L2 to enter target change mode; announces current enemy info
  - Cycles targets with directional input; each new target announced
  - Single-enemy battles: L2 re-reads current target's info (TargetChangeMode state detection)
  - Announces: name, HP %, shield %, leader type, active buffs/debuffs
  - HP shown as exact values if Spectacles item used on that enemy (IsSeeThroughEnemy check)
  - Enemy names resolved via ConstEnemyParameter.charaNameID → ParseCharaNameID fallback
  - Duplicate enemy names numbered (e.g. "Lizardaxe 1", "Lizardaxe 2")
  - Detection: SetControlPlayerTarget hook (CallerCount 7) + polling as backup
  - Spectacles is the ONLY see-through mechanism (no Analyze spell in this game)

- **Camp equip sub-screen announcements** (`CampMenuHandler.cs`) ✓ TESTED
  - Slot list reads category before item name: "Weapon: Swift sword, 1 of 7."
  - Empty slots read "Greaves: None, 5 of 7." instead of being silent
  - Fixed: item list detection now uses currentState instead of activeInHierarchy

- **Camp skills sub-screen announcements** (`CampMenuHandler.cs`) ✓ TESTED

- **Save game screen detection** (`LoadGameHandler.cs`) ✓ TESTED

- **Shop menu announcements** (`ShopHandler.cs`) ✓ TESTED

  - Quantity selection reads count + total Fol on change

- **Item acquisition popups** (`NotificationHandler.cs`) ✓ TESTED
  - Treasure chest and quest reward popups now read aloud
  - Announces the game's message text plus each item name and count
  - Hook: UIOverflowItemPresenter.SetItem (CallerCount 3, fires when popup is populated)

- **Battle dodge warning audio cue** (`BattleCounterHandler.cs`, `AudioCuePlayer.cs`) — PENDING TEST (updated to file-based WAV)
  - Plays Dodge.wav when an enemy is about to hit the player (dodge warning)
  - Hook: BattleCharacter.DoAttackNotify postfix — the game's own visual flash trigger
  - Only fires when target.IsControlPlayer() — ignores attacks on party members
  - Audio: WAV loaded from UserData/SO2RAccess/Sounds/Dodge.wav via winmm.dll (unmanaged memory)
  - Settings: ModSettings.DodgeSoundEnabled (on/off) and DodgeSoundVolume (0.0-1.0, default 0.8)
  - Volume-adjusted WAV cached in unmanaged memory, rebuilt only when volume setting changes
  - Refactored: shared TryParseWav() and ScalePcmSamples() helpers (dodge + save sound use same code)

- **Enemy proximity audio cue** (`EnemyProximityHandler.cs`, `SpatialAudioPlayer.cs`) — PENDING TEST
  - Looping spatial WAV cue warns of nearby field enemies
  - Volume scales with distance: full at 3 units, silent at 25 units
  - Stereo panning based on enemy direction relative to player's facing
  - Tracks closest enemy only; scans every ~60 frames via FindObjectsOfType<FieldEnemy>()
  - Audio engine: waveOut API (winmm.dll) with double-buffered stereo output
  - Separate from AudioCuePlayer (no conflict with dodge warning)
  - WAV file loaded from disk (UserData/SO2RAccess/Sounds/Enemy_proximity.wav) — swappable
  - UserVolume property ready for future mod settings menu
  - Deadlock bug fixed: Stop() sets _playing=false before waveOutReset to prevent callback deadlock

  - Polling-based (native navigation, same pattern as shop/camp)
  - FindObjectOfType<UIGameOverWindow> with IsOpened polling

- **Camp status talents sub-screen** (`CampMenuHandler.cs`) ✓ TESTED
  - Hook: UITalentPresenter.Set(List<UITalentData>) — CallerCount(1)
  - Announces "Talents." heading + comma-separated talent names
  - Hook fires on status open (page 0), data CACHED; announced when pageIndex changes to 1
  - If character changes while on talent page, hook fires and announces immediately
  - Stats announcement gated to page 0 (prevents stats reading on talent page)

- **Location discovery notifications** (`NotificationHandler.cs`) ✓ TESTED
  - Hook: UIFieldLocationPointPresenter.Set(string name, string description) — CallerCount(1)
  - Announces "Discovered [name]. [description]" when a location marker popup appears
  - Rewards now handled separately by stacked field notification queue (no longer inline)

- **Map name announcement on area change** (`NavigationHandler.cs`) ✓ TESTED
  - Polls FieldManager.Instance.currentFieldmapID each frame
  - When fieldmap changes, resolves name via ParameterManager/TextManager and announces
  - Skips first detection (game load) to avoid announcing on initial scene
  - Reuses existing ResolveMapName logic (overrides, game data, fallback)

- **Stacked field reward notifications** (`NotificationHandler.cs`) ✓ TESTED
  - Hook: UIFieldInformationStackSelector.ShowInformation — CallerCount(15)
  - Queues rapid-fire notifications (EXP, Fol, items, level-ups, talents, etc.)
  - Announces all queued messages combined after 0.5s delay to prevent interruption
  - Supports item-style notifications with getText/count/unit fields

  - Hook: UIDialogWindow.SetupAutoSaveAnnounce (CallerCount 2) — reads new game save notification dialog
  - Hook: GameSaveManager.Save prefix (CallerCount 3) — detects manual save start
  - Hook: GameSaveManager.OnSaveSuccess postfix (CallerCount 1) — detects save completion
  - Polling: GameSaveManager.IsSaving() as backup (auto-saves)
  - Audio: plays Save_sound.wav from UserData/SO2RAccess/Sounds/ via winmm.dll (unmanaged memory)
  - Settings: ModSettings.SaveSoundEnabled (on/off) and SaveSoundVolume (0.0-1.0, default 0.5)
  - Settings persisted to UserData/SO2RAccess/settings.json (created automatically)
  - Ready for future mod settings menu integration

## In-Progress / Pending Test

- **Camp status sub-screen announcements** (`CampMenuHandler.cs`) ✓ TESTED
  - Hook-driven detection: both activeInHierarchy and root-menu-hidden approaches failed;
    now uses UICampStatusSelector.UpdatePresenter hook as trigger

- **Navigation key remap + gamepad support** (`NavigationHandler.cs`, `Main.cs`) ✓ TESTED
  - Keyboard: NumPad 5 open/close, NumPad 1 auto-walk/cancel, F5 no longer used
  - Gamepad: L1 hold opens nav, D-pad Up/Down=category, Left/Right=items, LStick up=auto-walk
  - L1 suppresses D-pad directions + ShortCut actions + FieldCameraLeft while held in field
  - L1 does not activate in camp menu, battle, or dialogue (IsFieldFree check)
  - D-pad auto-repeat while held (400ms initial, 150ms interval)
  - Steam Input must be disabled for gamepad detection to work
  - Bug fixed: field shortcuts (Quick Heal) now blocked — ShortCut actions (39-42) added to suppression list

- **Navigation Events category** (`NavigationHandler.cs`) — NOT TESTED
  - New "Events" category added to nav list (5th category after Markers)
  - Scans FieldEventCollision objects, filtered by IsEventActivate() (only active triggers shown)
  - Classified as "Story event", "Private action", "Side event", or generic "Event"
  - Numbered by type in distance order (e.g. "Story event 1", "Private action 2")
  - NavMesh reachability filter applied; static transforms (LiveTransform = null)

- **Navigation Enemies category** (`NavigationHandler.cs`) — TESTED, WORKING
  - New "Enemies" category added to nav list (7th category)
  - Uses FindObjectsOfType<FieldEnemy>() to scan field enemy symbols
  - Enemies excluded from NPC category via TryCast<FieldEnemy>() filter
  - Name resolution: EncountID → encounter params → partyID → enemy params → charaNameID
  - TextManager doesn't resolve enemy names on field (not loaded); falls back to parsed charaNameID
  - e.g. CHARA_LIZARDAXE → "Lizardaxe", shown as "Lizardaxe, medium 1"
  - Difficulty from EnemySymbolType: weak, medium, strong, raid
  - Sorted by distance, NavMesh reachability filtered, duplicate labels numbered
  - Live transform tracking for auto-walk to enemies

- **Navigation Save Points category** (`NavigationHandler.cs`) ✓ TESTED
  - New "Save Points" category added to nav list (6th category)
  - Uses FieldManager.Instance.FieldSavePointList (game-managed list)
  - Labels: "Save point" or "Recovery save point" based on IsRecovery property
  - Numbered when multiples of the same type exist (e.g. "Save point 1", "Recovery save point 2")
  - NavMesh reachability filter applied; live transform tracking for auto-walk

- **Enhance menu sub-screen announcements** (`CampMenuHandler.BattleSkill.cs`, `CampMenuHandler.Formation.cs`) ✓ TESTED
  - Camp → Enhance shows 3 sub-items: Skill, CombatPoint, BattleSkillPoint
  - Gate checks expanded from "BattleSkill" to also accept "BattleSkillPoint" and "CombatPoint"
  - Hook-based deferred detection: activeInHierarchy always true, so heading + inner selector
    caching deferred to UIBattleSkillInformationPresenter.Set hook on first fire
  - Combat skills (CombatPoint): BP balance/cost per skill, max level indicator, toggle mode (Square)
  - Battle skills (BattleSkillPoint): BP balance/cost per skill, max level indicator
  - Skills (Skill): SP balance/cost per skill, max level indicator
  - Balance shown per-skill as "BP: 28 / 5" or "SP: 100 / 5" (not on heading)
  - Toggle mode (Square button): announces "Toggle mode", skill active/inactive status on navigate and confirm
  - Double punctuation fix: AppendSentence helper strips trailing periods from game text

- **Camp formation sub-screen announcements** (`CampMenuHandler.cs`) — NOT TESTED (needs more party members)

- **Camp operations child screens** (`CampMenuHandler.cs`)
  - Operations root menu reads its items (Formation, Party Formation, Assist Formation, Tactics) ✓
  - Formation: existing handler (gated on root item name "Formation") — NOT TESTED (needs more party members)
  - Party Formation: polls UICampSelectCharacterSelector.GetCurrentIndex(), data from SetStatus hook — NOT TESTED (needs more party members)
  - Assist Formation: polls UICampAssistSettingSelector (Equip slots + character picker) — NOT TESTED (needs more party members)
  - Tactics: polls UICampOperationSelector (character + operation states), hook for operation info ✓ TESTED

## In-Progress Features

- **Field Navigation — Phase 2 (audio list + auto-run)** (`NavigationHandler.cs`) ✓ COMPLETE AND TESTED
  - F5: open/close navigation list; also cancels auto-run if active
  - NumPad 8/2: navigate up/down within category
  - NumPad 4/6: switch category (NPCs, Chests, Exits, Markers, Events, Save Points, Enemies)
  - NumPad 5: auto-run to selected item; press again to stop following
  - Items sorted by distance (closest first) within each category
  - Party members filtered (dist < 2 units)
  - NPC names: parsed from ConstNpcParameter code name; functional NPCs qualified e.g. "Equipment shop (Hahn)"
  - Chests: numbered by type in distance order (Unopened chest 1, Unopened chest 2 etc.)
  - Exits: labelled by icon type + game map name (e.g. "Building entrance to Arlia Village", "Town gate to Overworld")
  - **NavMesh pathfinding** (Phase 2.5): auto-walk uses NavMesh.CalculatePath() for wall-respecting paths instead of straight-line movement. Unreachable targets filtered from nav list on F5. Path recalculates every 1.5s for moving NPCs. Terrain height followed via waypoint Y interpolation. Falls back gracefully if no NavMesh in scene.
  - Auto-run: NavMesh waypoint-following at player's actual run speed (GetMoveSpeed(true) = 6.5); live transform tracking so wandering NPCs are followed
  - Run animation + footsteps: Harmony prefix blocks game from resetting Run to Unique/Idle each frame; PlayMoveAnimation(Run) called once at start
  - Auto-run NPC arrival: proximity-lock mode — player held 1 unit from NPC, facing them, until NumPad 5 pressed
  - Auto-run static arrival (exits, markers): stops and announces "Arrived"
  - Scene change cancels auto-run silently

## Known Issues / Future Work

- **Bug: Battle skill menu triggers stale announcement on next camp open** — FIXED:
  All sub-screen gates now preserve their `_xxxWasActive` and `_xxxLastIndex` state when
  the root menu cursor moves away, preventing stale re-activation announcements.
  Same fix also resolved stale item announcements on shop open and camp menu scrolling.

- **Bug: Equip screen missing category name when slot is empty** — FIXED:
  Slot list now reads category before item name (e.g. "Weapon: Swift sword").
  Empty slots read "Category: None". Root cause was _equipItemListActive using
  activeInHierarchy (always true) — slot polling never ran. Fixed by using
  UICampEquipSelector.currentState (State.EquipType vs State.Item) instead.

- **Camp status detection** — FIXED: Both activeInHierarchy and root-menu-hidden detection
  failed (root menu selector also stays activeInHierarchy=true in sub-screens). Now fully
  hook-driven via UICampStatusSelector.UpdatePresenter (fires on open + character tab change).

- **Bug: Auto-walk arrival interrupts tutorial/notification speech** — FIXED:
  AnnounceArrival() checks if something was spoken in the last 0.5s via
  ScreenReader.GetRecentMessage(). If so, combines arrival first + interrupted
  message second into one announcement so the user hears both.

- **Bug: L1 nav blocked after camp menu** — FIXED: Camp closure detection used
  gameObject.activeInHierarchy which stays true after camp closes. Changed to
  WindowComponent.IsOpened property which properly reflects open/closed state.

- **Bug: Nav menu opened during camp menu via L1** — FIXED: IsOpened returns false
  during the camp window's opening animation (~36ms), causing IsCampOpen to be
  cleared immediately. Added 1-second grace period after Open postfix fires.
  Also added IsCampOpen gate in Main.ProcessGamepad (L1 press) and
  IsFieldFree check in NavigationHandler.ToggleNavList (keyboard NumPad 5).

- **NPC functional role + name combining** — shop/inn/guild NPCs now shown as e.g.
  "Equipment shop (Hahn)". Needs more in-game testing as more NPCs are encountered.

- **Counter NPC NavMesh fix** — FIXED: Functional NPCs (shops, inns, guilds, collectors,
  facilities) behind counters were filtered out by the NavMesh reachability check because
  no walkable path exists through the counter. Now these NPC types skip the reachability
  filter. Auto-walk uses partial NavMesh path to walk the player to the counter, then
  announces arrival. Player faces the NPC and can press action to interact.

- **Map exit names** — FIXED: Now resolved from game data at runtime via
  ParameterManager.GetFieldParameter(fieldmapID).FieldmapNameID → TextManager.GetMessage().
  Buildings show real names instead of codes like "22A". Results cached per session.

- **Gamepad nav menu** — IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED. L1 hold-to-open with D-pad navigation.
  See Key Bindings (Mod) section above for full control scheme.

## Code Cleanup (2026-03-01)

Cleanup branch `claude-mod-cleanup` merged to master. Key changes:

- **File splitting:** CampMenuHandler split into 7 partial files (core, BattleSkill, Equip, Formation, Items, Party, Status). NavigationHandler split into 4 (core, AutoWalk, Build, Patches).
- **New shared utilities:** `TextUtil.cs` (StripTags consolidation), `FieldState.cs` (IsFieldFree consolidation)
- **Config slider bug fixed:** gauges now read `currentIndex` instead of animated `value.text` — values are correct immediately
- **Silent catches fixed:** 6 bare `catch {}` blocks replaced with proper logging
- **Dead code removed:** unused hook registration, dead localization key, commented-out hotkey code
- **Helpers extracted:** `SortAndFilterUnreachable()` (replaced 8 copies), `SuppressNavInput()`, `AppendSkillInfo()`
- **Hardcoded strings moved to Loc.Get():** GameOverHandler retry/title, CampMenuHandler.Party position/status
- **OnSceneChanged added to CampMenuHandler:** prevents stale IsCampOpen if scene changes while camp is open
- **IsFieldFree now checks ShopHandler.IsShopOpen** in NavigationHandler (was missing before)
- **DIAG logs removed:** ~30 unconditional MelonLogger.Msg("DIAG:...") lines removed from ConfigMenuHandler
- **Deferred (low priority):** stale-open check helper consolidation, UpdateXxx polling pattern helper, StripControllerPrefix consolidation across NotificationHandler/GamepadMenuHandler

- Game uses Unity NEW Input System — use Keyboard.current[Key.Fx].wasPressedThisFrame (NOT Input.GetKeyDown)
- Game singletons all use ClassName.Instance pattern (SingletonMonoBehaviour)
- Game code namespace: Il2CppGame — must add `using Il2CppGame;` to access game classes
- Required csproj references for IL2CPP: Il2Cppmscorlib.dll + Il2CppInterop.Runtime.dll

## Notes for Next Session

### Audio clip ready for integration
- **File:** `E:\StarOcean\audio_cue.wav` — 10-second clip (PCM WAV, 44100 Hz, 16-bit mono, ~861 KB)
- **Source:** YouTube clip trimmed from 5s to 15s
- **User has a specific use in mind** — to be implemented in a future session

### Current work (2026-03-01)
New this session:
- BattleTargetHandler: L2 target cycling announces enemy name, HP%, shield%, leader, buffs/debuffs ✓ TESTED
- BattleResultHandler enhanced: SP, BSP totals + per-character BSP + learned skill names (PENDING RETEST)
- CampMenuHandler.BattleSkill: Enhance sub-menu gates expanded for CombatPoint/BattleSkillPoint (PENDING TEST)
- SaveNotificationHandler: save sound cue on manual/auto save ✓ TESTED
- ModSettings: JSON persistence for sound toggle/volume settings
- AudioCuePlayer: refactored to file-based WAV (dodge + save sounds from disk)
- TextUtil: shared ParseCharaNameID (was duplicated in NavigationHandler)

### Battle target lessons learned
- ShowSelectedTargetEnemy (CallerCount 3) does NOT fire for L2 target switching — likely for skill targeting
- SetControlPlayerTarget (CallerCount 7) is the correct hook for L2 target changes
- CharacterParameter.CharacterName is empty for battle enemies — use ConstEnemyParameter.charaNameID fallback
- BattleManager.stateMachine.currentState == 5 detects TargetChangeMode (for single-enemy re-reads)
- Spectacles is the ONLY see-through mechanism; no Analyze spell exists
- Elemental resistances only shown in pause menu (not during active combat)

### Previous test results (still valid)
- All nav, camp, shop, battle result, skills, save, status features working as documented above

### Key lesson learned
- Camp menu root selector activeInHierarchy stays true even when sub-screens are open.
  This means activeInHierarchy-based detection fails for ALL camp sub-screens.
  Hook-driven detection (used for status) is the reliable alternative when polling fails.

### Camp menu architecture (critical for sub-screen work)
- Root: UICampMenuSelector (menuSelector field on UICampWindow) — DONE
- Sub-screens are separate selector classes, all fields on UICampWindow:
  - itemSelector (UICampItemSelector)
  - statusSelector (UICampStatusSelector)
  - equipSelector (likely UICampEquipSelector)
  - battleSkillSelector, operationSelector, skillSelector, formationSelector
- Each sub-screen needs its own polling loop or hook
- Pattern: access the selector via UICampWindow field, poll currentIndex
- Item names: UICampMenuItemData.menuItem is UIDefine.CampMenuItem enum (toString gives
  e.g. "Status", "Item", "Equip", "BattleSkill", "Formation") — consider adding friendly
  Loc entries (e.g. "BattleSkill" → "Battle Skills") in a follow-up

### CRITICAL: Camp menu patching lessons learned
- Camp navigation is driven entirely from native C++ — NO Harmony hook fires for navigation
  (tested: UpdatePresenter, OnMoveCursor, OnUp, OnDown, Show, UICanSelectedListItemPresenterBase.OnSelected — all failed)
- Methods with CallerCount(0) called only from native code are NOT interceptable via Harmony
- Polling currentIndex from Main.UpdateHandlers() is the correct approach for this menu
- GetComponentInChildren<T>() fails for camp selectors — use the named fields on UICampWindow
- UICampCommandSelector is NOT the root menu — it may be unused in the demo or is a sub-selector

### Animation system notes (for future reference)
- Game uses FieldBillboardObject.PlayMoveAnimation(FieldAnimationKind) as the animation trigger
- CharacterAnimationAccessor.LateUpdate() (MonoBehaviour) resets animation to "Unique" each frame when no input
- MelonLoader OnLateUpdate fires BEFORE game MonoBehaviour LateUpdates — cannot override there
- Solution: Harmony prefix on PlayMoveAnimation blocks non-Run calls on the player during approach
- Player run speed: GetMoveSpeed(true) = 6.5 units/second

### Next feature candidates
- In-game test: Navigation Events category (does FieldEventCollision show active triggers?)
- Navigation: Enemies — DONE ✓ (parsed names, TextManager doesn't resolve on field)
- Navigation: Save points (FieldSavePoint via FieldManager.FieldSavePointList) — DONE ✓
- Navigation: Doors (FieldDoor via FieldManager.FieldDoorList) — dungeon doors, open/close state
- Navigation: Stairs (FieldStairs via FieldManager.FieldStairsList) — vertical transitions
- Navigation: Gimmicks (FieldGimmick01-18) — dungeon puzzle objects (warp gates, switches, etc.)
- Navigation: Flavor chat triggers (FieldFlavorChatCollision) — party banter spots
- Operations child screens: Party Formation, Assist Formation, Formation — pending test (need more party members)
- Camp sub-screen: skill learning (UICampSkillLearningSelector — complex, deferred)
- Battle pause menu handler (detailed enemy info: element resistances, buffs, HP when spectacled)
- Battle status announcements (player HP/MP during combat)
- Known bug: battle skill leveling inner menus (spending points) don't announce — fix later

### Notes
- Build command: `dotnet build SO2RAccess.csproj` (auto-copies to Mods folder)
- Map exit names now resolved from game data automatically (ConstFieldParameter + TextManager)
